# Cosmos Flutter Pack❤
_Developed by JeaFriday🎶_

## Why was it developed?
Thanks to this package, which brings together the challenging materials created as a result of the efforts of many developers, no application will make you struggle with lines of code!

## Included in the Package
> **CosmosAlert:** An alert viewer with options such as IOS, Material and customizable. Use it as a screen or just show alerts.

> **Cosmos Button's:** Instead of complicated button stuff, customizable and easier to access buttons included in the Cosmos package.

> **CosmosScroller:** An auto-scrollable layout. With this widget you can get a complete scrolling experience in the desired direction.

> **CosmosBody:** A fast (Column) layout developed for the 'body' feature of the Scaffold widget, offering automatic scrolling.

> **CosmosTextBox:** A fully customizable TextField widget. It's a masterpiece with its own frames and customizable parts.

> **CosmosFirebase:** A Flutter package developed for Google Firebase. Saving data to the database, extracting data, creating profiles and much more.

> **CosmosTools:** CosmosTools contains the potential tools you may need.

> **CosmosColor:** Color tools.

> **CosmosImage:** With CosmosImage, it automatically detects your images in a single way, determines whether they are a network or an asset, and displays them accordingly. It prevents delays that may occur in reloads by saving images coming from the internet to the cache.

> **CosmosTelegram:** A tool that makes it easy for you to send messages using the Telegram API.

> **CosmosTopBar:** Creates a top bar for your apps. This bar has a responsive layout.

> **CosmosSideMenu:** Adds a side menu to your application.

> **openSideMenu:** Side opens the menu.

> **CosmosNavigation:** By adding a bottom bar to your app, it will create a bottomBar as you want.

> **CosmosCheckBox:** It is a more understandable, simple and very sweet CheckBox instead of the stupid CheckBox found in the Flutter package.

> **CosmosInfo:** A quick Tooltip.

> **height, width, heightPercentage, widthPercentage:** It allows you to perform operations with screen aspect ratios. It acts somewhat like the 'MediaQuery.sizeOf(context).width' class.
